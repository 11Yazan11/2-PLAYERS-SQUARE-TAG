## Features
This project provides a tag game : 2 players represented by 2 squares can move in a map. One of them must tag the other one. The faster he does it, the most point he will get. Moreover, it is possible to switch to map customization mode (by answering True at the beggining). Once you are done drawing you are asked if you want to save the map, and if you want to delete the other maps. It is better to delete them from time to time to not run out of memory. For the playing mode, commands are "q = left, z = up, s = down, d = right" for the first player, and arrow keys for the second player. And for the drawing mode, commands are indicated in the window name. You must select red, green, or blue, (with a, z, or e keys respectivly) first, then you can increase/decrease the values to get the color you want. Then you can also change the size of the square you will draw (r to increase, t to decrease, these keys should be long pressed). Finally, simply click on the square(s) you want to color.
