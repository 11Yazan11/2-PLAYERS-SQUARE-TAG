## Features
This project provides a tag game : 2 players represented by 2 squares can move in a map. One of them must tag the other one. The faster he does it, the most point he will get. Moreover, by simply switching the "draw" variable in main.py file from False to True, and uncommenting the printing [line][165], it is possible to customize the map. The output is printed in the python console when the window is closed. It is a numpy array. Just copy paste it, and replace everything in matrix.py, with it. Don't forget to erase the run-time (at the end) and the running info as well as the pygame welcoming message (at the beginning). Also, write "matrix = " at the beggining, where this matrix will be thus equal to what you previously drew. Then, just rechange the mode : "draw = False" (and comment the printing line if you want).
