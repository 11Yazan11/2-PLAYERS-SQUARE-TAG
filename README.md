## Features
This project provides a tag game : 2 players represented by 2 squares can move in a map. One of them must tag the other one. The faster he does it, the most point he will get. Moreover, it is possible to switch to map customization mode (by answering True at the beggining). Once you are done drawing : the output (your new map) is printed in the python console (when the window is closed). It is a numpy array. Just copy paste it, and replace everything in matrix.py, with it. Don't forget to delete the run-time (at the end) if you also copied it. Also, write "matrix = " at the beggining. Thus the new matrix will thus be equal to what you previously drew.
